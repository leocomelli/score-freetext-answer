  <questionText>John wanted to find the optimum conditions for growing peas. He planted pea seeds in 2 separate pots. He used the same amount and type of soil in each pot. He recorded daily care (amount of water and plant food) and results (plant length and number of leaves) after 2 weeks, as shown in the following chart. Did John do a good job of controlling the variables in his experiment? Explain why or why not.</questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="EV_22a-a1">No. John changed 2 variables at the same time (amount of water and amount of plant food) so John can not know which variables made a difference.</referenceAnswer>

  <studentAnswers>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.111.1" accuracy="correct">No, Because John changed 2 variables not one. They are Pot A 25 milliliters of water 2 grams of food, Pot B 100 milliliters of water one gram of food.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.114.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, He did no have a controlled experiment.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.115.1" accuracy="correct">No, He did not do a good job because he changed 2 variables; water and food.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.116.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, It seems to be going fine well.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.117.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, Because he did not have Pot B the same as Pot A.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.118.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, Because the way he made the chart to stay organized.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.119.1" accuracy="correct">No, Because he changed 2 variables.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.120.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, Because he did not control his variables.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.123.1" accuracy="correct">No, Because he changed more than one variable; water and plant food.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.125.1" accuracy="correct">No, Because he changed 2 variables.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.126.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, Because in Pot A he used 75 milliliters then Pot B had 100 milliliters it is a big difference.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.128.1" accuracy="correct">No, He changed the water and the food and to have a controlled experiment you can only change one variable.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.133.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, He does not tell if the plant got sunlight or oxygen.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.138.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, Because he did the same thing a scientist would do by jotting down notes.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.143.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, Because it is neat, he recorded all plants, and he changed the watered and food to find the plants preferred environment.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.148.1" accuracy="correct">No, Because he changed too many variables in his experiment.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.160.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, Because the earth is sort of hard to read.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.177.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, Because for Pot B he put 100 milliliters this has too much water!</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.183.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, Because too much water and less food does not make the plant feel good.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.185.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, I chose no because he needs to explain more in his experiment like what he measured.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.241.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, John did a great job because he has how many leaves grow and how tall it is and how much water and how much plant food.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.242.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, Because he used different amount of water and food and also watched both of them each day.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.244.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, He only used 2 kinds of pots. John needs more types of variables being changed.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.245.1" accuracy="incorrect">No, Because not only does he need more conditions but I still do not see the right amount of variables. The results do not really explain much.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.326.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, Because he did different amounts of water a plant food to see which one would grow better.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.328.1" accuracy="correct">No, Because the reason Pot B did not do so well could be too much water, or no enough plant food, you could not know.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.329.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, Because he records his data and puts the same amount in one pot then does the same thing to another but another amount.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.330.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, John did a good job he put how much water, how much plant food, the length, the number of leaves. I like how he did his experiment.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.331.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, If he is trying to find the optimum condition he needs to test different stuff on each pot.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.443.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, I think he did a good job because he tested the same plant in different pots and put different amounts of water and food. It was good that he tested 2 because if he only had one he would not have anything to compare it with and find if it is good or not.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.444.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, Yes because he used different amounts of water and food. He also used the same type of soil in both pots.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.530.1" accuracy="correct">No, no because in pot A he put 2 grams of plant food and in pot B one gram of plant food and he is only suppose to change water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.532.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, yes because in pot B it was 100 and one gram and length it is 7 and for number it is only and it is good.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.533.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, because he wrote all his information.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.534.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, because on pot A he used 75 milliliters and got one more centimeters then pot B also he got more leaves on his plant in pot A.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.535.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, Yes because he put one more water one gram more on pot A and they grew more leaves and had the biggest length.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="EV.22a.536.1" accuracy="incorrect">Yes, yes because John put everything in the right order for pot A and B.</studentAnswer>
