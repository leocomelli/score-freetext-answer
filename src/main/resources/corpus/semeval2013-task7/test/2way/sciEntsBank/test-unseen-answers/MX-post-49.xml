  <questionText>Beth made 2 solutions of different concentrations of water and citric acid. She put 50 milliliters of the first solution in cup X and 50 milliliters of the second solution in cup Y. When she put the cups on the balance, the balance looked as shown below. Which solution, X or Y, is more concentrated? Explain how you know which is more concentrated.</questionText>

    <referenceAnswer id="MX_49-a1">X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.</referenceAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="MX.49.385.1" accuracy="correct">X, cup x is a lot more concentrated because x is more heavy.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.49.392.1" accuracy="incorrect">Y, I think y because x just because it is heavier does not mean that that is more concentrated. I think it means it is less concentrated because there is more room the more water the more room.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.49.467.1" accuracy="correct">X, because solution x weighs more and has more solute.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="MX.49.488.1" accuracy="incorrect">X, because cup x has more stuff in it than cup y. cup y could still hold more.</studentAnswer>
