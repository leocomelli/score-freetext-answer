  <questionText>Shanna stuck one end of a clear straw into a ball of clay. She filled the straw part way with water and marked the water level. She then placed it in the freezer. Which statement describes the level of the water (ice) in the straw after it froze? (Circle the one best answer.) A. The water level went down when the water froze. B. The water level stayed the same when the water froze. C. The water level went up when the water froze. Explain your answer.</questionText>

    <studentAnswer id="WA.30b.171.1" accuracy="incorrect">It stayed the same because there was something that was covering the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.30b.173.1" accuracy="incorrect">When Shanna put the straw into the freezer the water level went down because cold water is less dense so the level went down.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.30b.175.1" accuracy="correct">When water freezes it contracts then expands.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.30b.176.1" accuracy="correct">When the water freezes the water molecules are trying to be the warmest so they huddle together then expand.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.30b.179.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because if you put ice in water it makes water level go up.</studentAnswer>
