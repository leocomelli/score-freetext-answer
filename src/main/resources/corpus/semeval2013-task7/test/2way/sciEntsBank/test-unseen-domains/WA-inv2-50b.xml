    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.172.1" accuracy="correct">My evidence is the picture. When an object is denser than water, it shrinks. The picture showed that the marble sinks, so the marble is denser than the water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.175.1" accuracy="correct">When something is more dense than water it will sink which is what the marble did.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.177.1" accuracy="correct">Because it is a solid hard rock. But if it was ice it would not sink it would float.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.180.1" accuracy="correct">The marble is denser so the denser it is the more it sinks.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.185.1" accuracy="incorrect">When the red, hot water in a little cup, the water that is red goes to the bottom of the cup. When it is a little cup of blue, cold water that water stays at the top.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.188.1" accuracy="correct">When something is denser than water it sinks, and when something is less dense then it floats.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.189.1" accuracy="correct">The marble in the water is at the bottom.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.191.1" accuracy="correct">The marble is denser than the water that is why it sank.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.193.1" accuracy="correct">My evidence is that the marble sunk.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.194.1" accuracy="correct">Because a marble is heavy so it will go down.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.206.1" accuracy="correct">The marble sank.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.207.1" accuracy="incorrect">The marble is denser than the water because it has air bubbles.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.208.1" accuracy="correct">I chose C because when something sinks to the bottom it is more dense than the water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.209.1" accuracy="correct">The marble sunk.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.210.1" accuracy="correct">Well, it sank so that means it is more dense than the water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.211.1" accuracy="correct">The marble sinks when it is more dense.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.212.1" accuracy="correct">If the marble was less dense it would float.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.213.1" accuracy="correct">Because it was denser, so it sank.</studentAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.610.1" accuracy="correct">Because the marble is heavier then the water.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="WA.50b.611.1" accuracy="incorrect">No answer.</studentAnswer>
