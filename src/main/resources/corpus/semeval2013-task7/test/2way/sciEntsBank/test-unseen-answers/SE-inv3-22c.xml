  <questionText>Andi and Scott decided to investigate solar water heaters using collectors of different colors (but the same size) as one variable and covered versus uncovered as a second variable.

    <studentAnswer id="SE.22c.166.1" accuracy="correct">Because the red is uncovered and blue is covered and you cannot compare them.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="SE.22c.248.1" accuracy="correct">Red uncovered water is not really hot, and the blue covered is hot, so when you compare them you would not get that much of useful information.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="SE.22c.401.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because one is uncovered and one is covered. Also I think because they are now the same color.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="SE.22c.527.1" accuracy="incorrect">Because blue goes so high and red goes so low you cannot tell anything.</studentAnswer>
